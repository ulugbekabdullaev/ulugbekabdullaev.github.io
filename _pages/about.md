I am a master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu). My research interests are at the intersection of control theory and machine learning. My thesis is about the integration of Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with "off-policy" Reinforcement Learning. I am privileged to be advised by Prof. [Vijay Gupta](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Vijay-Gupta). I have a strong background and deep interest in mathematics, specifically optimization and probability theory. I completed my bachelor's degree in Automation and Control from Tashkent State Transport University, Uzbekistan, in 2023.
