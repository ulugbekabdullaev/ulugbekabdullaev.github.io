I am a master's student at [Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) working with Prof. [Vijay Gupta](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Vijay-Gupta). My research interests are at the intersection of control theory and machine learning. I am working on applying Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning to Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem. I have a strong background and deep interest in mathematics, specifically optimization and probability theory. I completed my bachelor's degree in Automation and Control from [Tashkent State Transport University](https://tstu.uz/), Uzbekistan, in 2023.
